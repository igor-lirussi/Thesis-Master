Humans are capable of executing a wide variety of complex actions, based on prior experience. 
In this thesis, we provided a possible approach to novel high-level skill generation by combining movement primitives learned by CNMP models. 

\section{Future work}
Possible future works are ...
% 
% variable functions for transition
% CNMP with tp only in query,  how to condition with one state parameterless and let the network, queried with different tasks, pass through that state.
% this research leaves many challenges open to tackle, from planning, to a better world representation to better perception and grasping
% other areas in which the network can be used is trajecories for navigation
% Further research is needed on the only tp query net, could include better training to improve the results in the interpolation dimensions. For example condition with in between TPs during training to force mixed task parameters trajectories to pass through the designated point. 
% could be a deeper decoder, maybe with RNN

% CNMP deals with a lot of dimensions, the world representation can be extended with a top-down image
