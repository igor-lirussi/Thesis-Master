Key challenge is creating robots that are capable of directly interacting with the world around them  and robot manipulation is central in this. \cite{kroemer2021review}
 
The ability to solve high level goals in robot is increasing \cite{gupta2019relay}, \cite{simeonov2021long} thanks to  ... 


Some may follow natural language instructions \cite{hu2019hierarchical}
%
Gaussian processes are used in ML \cite{seeger2004gaussian}
For instance in \cite{Ugur-RSS-19} the authors propose a novel ... 
And in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1807-01613} we can find Conditional Neural Processes.
